Pass-through taxation is a tax treatment that applies to certain types of business entities, such as Limited Liability Companies (LLCs). It refers to the way the income or losses generated by the business "pass through" the business entity and are reported on the owners' personal tax returns, rather than being taxed at the business level.

Here's how pass-through taxation works in the context of forming an LLC:

1. **Separate Legal Entity:** When you form an LLC, it becomes a separate legal entity distinct from its owners (also known as members). This separation provides limited liability protection, meaning members' personal assets are generally shielded from business liabilities.

2. **Taxation at the Individual Level:** Unlike corporations, which are subject to double taxation (taxed at the corporate level and then again when distributed to shareholders), LLCs benefit from pass-through taxation. This means that the income, losses, deductions, and credits of the LLC "pass through" to the individual members.

3. **Reporting on Personal Tax Returns:** Each member of the LLC includes their share of the business's income or losses on their individual tax returns. This is reported on their Schedule C (or other relevant form) as part of their personal income tax return.

4. **No Corporate Tax:** Because the LLC itself does not pay federal income taxes, it avoids double taxation. Instead, any tax liability is borne by the individual members based on their share of the LLC's income.

5. **Tax Treatment Flexibility:** LLCs have the flexibility to choose how they want to be taxed. By default, an LLC with multiple members is treated as a partnership for tax purposes. However, LLCs can also elect to be taxed as a corporation (if it's advantageous for certain tax strategies) or even as an S Corporation (in some cases).

It's important to note that while pass-through taxation offers advantages, it also has potential implications. Members are responsible for paying taxes on their share of the LLC's profits, even if those profits are not distributed to them. Additionally, self-employment taxes may apply to active members' share of the LLC's income.
